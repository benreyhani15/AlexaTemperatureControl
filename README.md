# AlexaTemperatureControl

This IoT project is an intelligent system that allows for control of different rooms in a home by interacting with Amazon's Alexa device. The central focus of this system is its Fuzzy logic controller which allows for voice commands that contain ambiguous temperature related terms (e.g. "Make kitchen warm" or "Make it cold in bedroom 1"). These "fuzzy" voice commands are in contrast to the typical voice commands implemented by other temperature control systems (e.g. "Make it 24 degrees celsius in the kitchen").
